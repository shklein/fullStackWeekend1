#Full Stack App

Convert your previous weekend 1 challenge application to utilize Node/Express, AJAX, and SQL. Any application logic can remain on the client side, but all data storage should be handled by the server and your database. Make use of Express routing modules to organize your server code. Your application should track salary usage on the page (original Pro Mode) and allow the user to remove this person from the list (original Hard Mode).

If the page is refreshed, it should load and display all stored and active employees.

Hard Mode
No more deleting! When the Remove button is clicked, do not delete this person from the database. Your app should just set them as inactive and not show them on the list. The salary total should account for only active employees.
